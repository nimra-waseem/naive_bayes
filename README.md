 Project Overview
This repository contains a hands-on machine learning project exploring the application of Naive Bayes classifiers. The primary goal is to predict student placement status using a placement.csv dataset. The notebook details the entire process, from data preparation to model training and visualization.

Key Concepts Explored
Naive Bayes Algorithm: A probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem with the "naive" assumption of feature independence.

Three Main Types of Naive Bayes:

Gaussian Naive Bayes: Used for continuous data that follows a normal distribution.

Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Ideal for binary features.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: Best suited for discrete data, such as word counts.

Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Decision Boundary Visualization: Using the mlxtend library to visualize how the classifier separates different classes in the feature space.

Dataset
The project uses a placement.csv file, which contains various features related to student performance and their final placement status (e.g., placed or not placed).

Note: The notebook assumes the features in this dataset follow a normal distribution, making it an ideal candidate for Gaussian Naive Bayes.

Project Steps
The Jupyter Notebook (naive_bayes_placement_prediction.ipynb) walks through the following steps:

Loading and Exploring Data: Loading the dataset and performing a quick exploratory data analysis.

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data for the model, including feature selection and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Instantiating and training a Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the training data.

Prediction and Evaluation: Making predictions on the test set and evaluating the model's accuracy.

Visualization of Decision Boundary: Using mlxtend to plot the decision regions and provide a visual understanding of the classifier's logic.
